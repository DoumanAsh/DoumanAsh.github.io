# First Post?

So here is blog of great me.
Honestly I'm not really fond of expressing my thoughts.
But I suppose from time to time even anti-social person, such as I am, may need it.

Interestedly I didn't go for existing blogging solutions.
While they sure make it easy, most of these solutions somewhat restrain you.
In case you're wondering you can take a look at vast amount of these generators [here](https://www.staticgen.com/).
To be honest I don't think [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is suitable for site generation yet I still went for it :).
It took some time, but eventually I had made simple generation from bunch of [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files.

So what you can expect of this blog?
Since I'm fond of coding, games and <span title="Cute">kawaii</span> girls, you can expect something along these themes.
_Note: Only 2D girls._

P.S. <span title="Just For Your Information">JFYI</span> English is not my native language, yet I'm going to use mostly it.
So you can expect some great grammar ;)
