<p>It's been a while from last post...?
Well, it is not like anyone is watching out for it.
The blog is purely for self-reflection.</p>
<p>Anyway recently I found Front-end job.
To be honest at that moment I had doubts about whether it would be actually interesting.
Still I decided to try it out.
After all when I had been learning this stuff, it was pretty interesting.</p>
<p>But of course it is interesting as long as you're free to do your own sites.
When it came to actual front-end job, I found myself in pretty boring environment.
The funniest thing is that almost all of the first week I was doing Back-end by means of node.js.
And it was fun. I learned about nice <span title="Object-relational mapping. In short: abstraction over DB">ORM</span> <a href="http://docs.sequelizejs.com/">Sequelize</a>.
I enjoyed it the first week, but then I has been moved to actual project I was signed for (yeah, it is strange delay).</p>
<p>There I found myself in front of big app and plus some serious admin app to manage it.
At first I had some issues with access rights and VPN... and well overall organization is rather chaotic.
Still I learned code  structure more or less. Sometimes it was a total mess, but there were good parts.
Especially in main app.</p>
<p>Moving to my impression of job.
I'm working for small company that is doing <em>serious</em> web apps for its clients.
Sounds great? But not really.
As many other projects in the company, there is not enough time to do everything properly.
I'm pretty laid off and I'm not going to bother myself with over-time (to be honest I even slacking sometimes but mostly because it is boring).
And since I'm pretty much on my own, I can take time to adjust.
At least for now no one is going to rush me.
But I heard that after week I'm going be left alone as other front-end devs are going on vacation or leaving company.
Sounds great, yeah?</p>
<p>And now what is actually bad about doing web for money...
As with many jobs you're pretty restricted in what you can do.
Not only by client, but by company itself.
I even heard that in most cases Back-end is copy-pasted from other projects using.
It seems company accumulated some templates for typical server side (in most cases it is awful Java).
As you're pretty much restricted I quickly got that I cannot do any creativity on design part.
My job is just bump in React components and let it work.</p>
<p>Did I tell you how awful big React project? (Note: I think it is a problem of any big front-end project)
It took me a few days just to get hang of it, but later one I spent almost a day tracking how exactly state change is going for ONE, CARL, ONE, reducer.
Luckily I was able to finish fixing Google map component today (first serious task and it took me almost four days).
Anyway to me front-end job kills any joy you can find there.
The only thing you need to do, as I already mentioned, bump in components and sync everything through redux.
In result you get 5mb, YES, CARL, FIVE DAMN MEGABYTES of JS code (I'm not even going to tell you amount of images, fetch requests and load time).</p>
<p>I know modern front-end is capable of great things.
But really, I can send several not-optimized PNGs in 5mb, and you have lots of JS code only.
Imagine my surprise when I first loaded the app....</p>
<p>Anyway, next Monday I'll bring resigned paper.
As per contract I can be forced to stay up to 30 days.
It is likely that they'll use this to find a new dev.
Well, it is my fault for wanting to quit.
Yep, I know it is bad that I haven't even finished my first month.
But you know: I don't want to work without motivation.
It is pretty ineffective for both me and my employee.</p>
<p>Guess I gonna back to C and C++.</p>
<p>P.s. Tomorrow gotta do C++ exercise for another company. :)</p>
