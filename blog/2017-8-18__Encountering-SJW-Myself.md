# Encountering SJW Myself

Recently I encountered some nasty result of western degradation.
Of course, while I'm not from western Europe or USA, I'm aware of <span title="Social Justice Warriror">SJW</span>.
They can call themself using different labels: feminists, progressive and etc.

While range of their ideas different I could sum it up as:
* White people and western civilization are oppressing other races
* Men are oppressing woman
* Discrimination against white people, especially male ones, is not an issue. They are oppressors.

Sadly one of these guys blocked me on twitter so I'm unable to view it (or maybe she even deleted it).
There was another [tweet](https://twitter.com/alicetragedy/status/897842247701581824) like that:
> Pro tip: reverse oppression does not exist.

Yes, they are serious.
SJW believe that all white people deserve to be oppressed just because they believe
white people are tyrants that oppress everyone else, white has all benefits in life, white always win.
Of course especially male ones.

Articles such as [this](https://www.bustle.com/articles/71400-6-reasons-men-can-literally-never-be-victims-of-sexism-and-those-who-think-they) are very common.
Following quote summarize all bullshit beliefs:
> The fact is, if you're a white, straight, middle-class man, then society operates in your favour, regardless of any instances of discrimination. You always win.

To be honest I wouldn't mind for that to be true.
At least I would always win and SJW wouldn't be lying at least in that regard.

## SJW in IT

The interesting thing is that there lots of SJW in IT industry.
Recent [incident](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo) with Google shows that SJW reached far there.
Short version: Guy got fired for writing well sourced paper on gender differences and how to mitigate it.

His goal was to show that Google's goal 50% of woman in IT company is difficult goal.
And Google didn't like it.
It seems upper management there is totally SJW so they just fired him since he isn't into progressive ideology.
I also heard there is lots of diversity trainings that not many appreciate, but they can do nothing about it.
After all not everyone can afford to get fired.

So what is surprising about it?
SJW is trendy so everyone into it.

The thing is that people in IT should be well educated and smart.
Yet they are being brainwashed easily into progressive ideology.
Of course not everyone and most likely it is affecting management rather than regular engineers.
Still, you can find 'diversity' initiatives among developers.

One would expect that smart IT people would value merit, rather than right skin colour and gender.
Yet some thinks that Open Source is too white and male, therefore we should give preferences to woman and non-white people.
Why? Just because they think otherwise it wouldn't change proportions.
It is difficult for them to accept that woman are less suitable to software engineering as they believe woman and man are 100% equal.
Natural differences between genders doesn't matter to them of course ;)

In a way I wrote it out of disappointment.
Being tweeted the blunt bullshit from other software developers makes me sad.

## Thoughts on future...

Do I expect too much from people? Yes
Should we be afraid of current trend? Yes, too.

Consider this: _Google fired employee for contradicting their ideology._
What stops them from controlling your search results, banning you from using their services (which are pretty much vital).
Moreover they can carefully feed you 'right' information and you wouldn't even notice.

I definitely wouldn't want to find myself in future where 'right' ideology determines your evaluation or controls information.

Hopefully people eventually fights back against bullshit.
