<p>I do not really post public statements etc.
But this time even I feel butthurt by some cry baby using me to claim victim points and defame unjustly someone I respect.</p>
<p>So here goes our hero <a href="https://twitter.com/__phantomderp">PhD</a></p>
<p>First I do not deny whatever he claims about me specifically, after all it did happen.
Also I do not feel sorry for him even if he felt 'offended'.
But I do feel sorry for people who he tries to defame.
Hence this short reply to <a href="https://thephd.github.io/why-another-c++-c-rust-zig-systems-programming-conference">Why Another C++ Conference</a></p>
<h2>Defamation and Lies</h2>
<p>First I'd like to start with the only true statement in that article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I joined the CppLang Slack around 2017-2018, an incident occurred. A user by the name of Douman said “nigger”, hard R and everything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is indeed true.
I do feel sorry for admins of slack, but that's it.
I did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Now with that out of the way, let's go to his ~misunderstandings~ lies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he ended up getting banned from one of CppLang’s most rancorous “off topic” channels to help him resist the urge to say it again while still being able to participate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was banned from the slack.
I was allowed back only on verbal promise to avoid causing scenes in public channels.
Which I comply with and limited my presence in public channels.</p>
<p>Notice how he doesn't outright lie, but makes it look to fit narrative.
Truly professional victim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>donned a Slack emoji in his name with the tag to the effect of “Garbage human being”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not really related to that incident, but just public statement of me not supporting harmful SJW ideology.</p>
<p>Following is what happens when you play your victim role too much.
We have conspiracy now that makes anyone, who doesn't support his ideology, part of evil racist organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incensed at being slapped on the wrist for his transgression,
Douman confided in authorities higher than the Moderation team itself: the CppLang Admins.
And in them, Douman found exactly what he was looking for:
righteous justification against the “snowflakes” who couldn’t handle his “bad language”.
He linked up in a Slack channel called Unfiltered, an at-times locked channel where users did and could scream nigger, faggot,
and all sorts of other things, at anybody they wanted to. You think of a slur, and it was said in Unfiltered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole section about cpp slack reeks of his wild imagination.
It would seem after playing victim for so long, he sees conspiracy everywhere.</p>
<p>He doesn't even understand that channel rules are applying to public channels only, as a way to avoid causing flood and unproductive discussions.
There is no reason for these rules to be applied in private channel.
Said channel specifically was made to freely talk not only about C++, but other topics as well.
You could say it was channel of buddies.</p>
<p>I do not know who invited him, but it was clearly a mistake, since it led his imagination run even more wild.</p>
<p>Although let's be honest, he probably happy that he can spin it as conspiracy of admins, enabling him to defame good people.</p>
<h3>Douman is doubling down!?</h3>
<p>His defamation plot becomes obvious once he starts next paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Normally, this wouldn’t be that big of a deal: bigotry exists everywhere, it’s just the way things are, right? But uniquely in this case was the radicalization of Douman: from LARPing about being sorry for saying nigger, to – under the tutelage of the CppLang Slack Admins – manifesting as a full-throated jerk:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here you can clearly see what is the goal of bringing me in.
As I'm not ashamed of being honest and blunt, not to mention I'm just poor slav from shitty country, he uses <em>me</em> to create
narrative of racist conspiracy where slack admins are evil masterminds behind exclusion and other buzz words in C++ community.</p>
<p>Is that true?
Obviously anyone who knows admins would know that's not true.
They might be stern and dislike how people like PhD wastes time on promoting harmful ideology among C++ community, but they are not
some evil masterminds that have a lot of free time.
Boost is used by thousand of people and companies, there is a lot of work to do.
Yet he claims that boost authors and contributors have nothing else to do than creating conspiracy to exclude him?
Sure, he got quite an ego, not to mention imagination.</p>
<p>Last incident is about my comment on one of his videos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he commented on the video detailing some of the problems that the wider C++ community had</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All I did is basically post meme-worthy &quot;Where is C++?&quot; which is a hint to these victim playing people that C++ is about C++,
not diversity.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>And now the circle came around in full: the top Administration of the largest C++ Slack group encouraged and inspired others to be just as malicious and cruel in their treatment of others. Douman was already sliding down the slope, but after getting himself banned from multiple Rust spaces he spent a good portion of his time in the CppLang Slack, in the Rust channel, railing against Codes of Conduct and whatever else he was inclined to be pissed at. From the tokio Community server to many other places, Douman scourged community after community and was served ban after ban, a rather depressingly impressive feat. And yet the only place his wild-eyed, unscientific rhetoric was embraced in whole?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I became some sort of scourge.
You know what? I do not care about it.
I mean it is normal for us normal people to not understand first world problems.</p>
<p>The problem is that he creates a very smooth narrative (well for anyone who doesn't know actual people) of it being some sort of conspiracy created by cpp slack admins, hence making it evil.</p>
<p>I can see two goals that he tries to achieve here:</p>
<ol>
<li>He wants to achieve ultimate promotion using circlejerk of victimhood. By defaming productive members of community, he enables easier time to achieve his goals in C++ committee as there will be less and less people inclined to argue in fear of being labeled racist.
That's general goal of any SJW movement so it is nothing new. They are doing it for power, not for actual good of community.</li>
<li>I suspect he also has grudge against boost contributors and cpp slack admins in general. It is probably due to him playing victim for so long, that he started believe that it is because of them. Hence this grudge, if so, it is sad.</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>Finally I want <span title="Yes, PhD, you">you</span> to understand that you can talk about me whatever shit you want,
but do not use me to harm good people.
Go ahead and create your own community, become its overlord and enjoy circlejerk of victimhood.
Stop with your defamation, in some countries you can be sued for it.
Also as we say in our second world countries: Grow some skin already, stop being cry baby.</p>
