<p>So here is blog of great me.
Honestly I'm not really fond of expressing my thoughts.
But I suppose from time to time even anti-social person, such as I am, may need it.</p>
<p>Interestedly I didn't go for existing blogging solutions.
While they sure make it easy, most of these solutions somewhat restrain you.
In case you're wondering you can take a look at vast amount of these generators <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">here</a>.
To be honest I don't think <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> is suitable for site generation yet I still went for it :).
It took some time, but eventually I had made simple generation from bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> files.</p>
<p>So what you can expect of this blog?
Since I'm fond of coding, games and <span title="Cute">kawaii</span> girls, you can expect something along these themes.
<em>Note: Only 2D girls.</em></p>
<p>P.S. <span title="Just For Your Information">JFYI</span> English is not my native language, yet I'm going to use mostly it.
So you can expect some great grammar ;)</p>
